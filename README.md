# DSU-W2023-Web-Scraping
Web scraping is a critical skill for data scientists due to its ability to collect data from various sources on the internet, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain. With web scraping tools, data scientists can extract and analyze data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that may not be apparent from a single source. Web scraping also facilitates data cleaning and preprocessing, enabling data scientists to organize and structure data in a way that is suitable for analysis. Furthermore, web scraping can be used to enrich existing datasets by collecting additional data from the web. Automation is another key benefit of web scraping, allowing data scientists to collect data at regular intervals and track changes over time. Ultimately, web scraping is a powerful tool that enables data scientists to collect, explore, enrich, and automate data from a variety of sources, making it an essential skill for any data science project.

We have put together a collection of resources to help people get started with web scraping, including popular tools such as Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium. These tools offer different advantages and use cases, and it's important to understand their pros and cons before deciding which one to use for a particular project. Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is easy to use and suitable for small to medium-sized scraping tasks. Scrapy, on the other hand, is a more advanced web scraping framework that is better suited for larger and more complex projects. Selenium is a tool that can be used to automate web browsers and interact with dynamic web pages, making it ideal for scraping data from sites with heavy JavaScript usage. Each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we have outlined these in our resources to help users choose the right tool for their specific needs. The resources we have compiled are available on our Github page, and we encourage anyone interested in web scraping to check them out.
