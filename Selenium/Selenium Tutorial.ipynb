    "Selenium is a Python package that is used primarily for website testing and automation, though its capabilities also make it a useful web scraping tool. Using Selenium, you can simulate a user’s experience and interact with live websites, performing actions such as clicking buttons, selecting options from dropdown menus, typing entries into search bars, scrolling, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "These actions make Selenium a good choice to scrape dynamic websites, or interactive sites where the content or data displayed is dependent on user actions and other factors such as time and day or user demographics. It is also a very flexible tool capable of scraping a wide variety of websites using many different browsers and platforms (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, because Selenium is primarily a website automation tool, using it for web scraping requires some background knowledge of HTML code and web development. In addition, Selenium is slower compared to other Python web scraping packages such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy. The best use case for Selenium is scraping data from a dynamic website that requires clicking buttons or other interactive elements to access the data."

    "Selenium has a variety of methods that are used for testing websites, but for the purposes of web scraping, the most important ones you will need to know are `find_element()` and `find_elements()`. Similar to regular expression functions, these two methods find specific parts of a website based on the type of HTML element you specify. The first method `find_element()` finds the first instance that matches the element you specify while the plural version `find_elements()` finds all instances that match the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to perform an action such as clicking a button or scraping text from a website, you will want to find a specific HTML element that is unique to the button, text blob, or whatever the object of interest is. This unique element is what you will have Selenium \"find\" within the website's nested HTML structure so that you can interact with or scrape specific parts of the website. There are some common HTML elements that you can directly access such as ID, Name, and Class. However, if the object you are trying to access is not defined under one of these common categories, you can also access it indirectly using an XPath expression, which indexes a specific attribute that occurs after a more common item such as a class or ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from `find_element()` and `find_elements()`, you will also need to import the `By` class from the `selenium.webdriver.common.by` module to use attributes that reference specific HTML elements. The By class and corresponding attribute are typically the first argument in the `find_element()` or `find_elements()` method, specifying what type of HTML element you are trying to access. The second argument is the actual text of the element you are looking for, be it the ID, Class, or XPath. Below is a table with each attribute of By for each corresponding type of HTML element along with what each element typically looks like when it is embedded within HTML code and how you would apply its specific By attribute to Selenium code."

To access the button, we will need to \"inspect\" the website to find the HTML element that references the button. \n",

    "If we right click the button and inspect it, we can observe that there is not a clear class name or ID in the HTML code that references the button, but instead an attribute hidden in the middle of a larger body of HTML code: `analytics-event=\"All matches\"`. Because there is no By attribute that can directly access the element, this is an indication that in order to access the button, we will need to reference it indirectly using an XPath. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, XPaths take on the following format: `//tagName[@AttributeName=“Value”]`. Here, we access a specific attribute such as the button by using the name of the element at the start of the line (i.e. \"label\") and then access the button (\"Value\") using the attribute name that references the button.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the XPath we will use to reference the \"All matches\" button is  `'//label[@analytics-event=\"All matches\"]'`, which you can check by typing in the XPath into the Inspect element search bar to see if it highlights the correct button.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to command Selenium to access the button and click it, we will import `By` from the `selenium.webdriver.common.by` module and then create an object that references the button using the following command: `driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//label[@analytics-event=\"All matches\"]') `. Lastly, to click the button, we use the `.click()` method on the object we have just created."

    "This tutorial is by no means a comprehensive guide to Selenium, as there are other actions you can perform that aren't covered here such as putting entries into search bars, filling out forms, and scraping images, but it should give a general overview of how to set it up as well as some of the basic functionalities of the package such as clicking buttons, selecting options from dropdown menus, and pulling data from tables. We use a dynamic website in this tutorial to highlight the capabilities of Selenium, which are best applied to an interactive website.\n",

    "One important note to remember about Selenium is that it is primarily used for website testing and automation rather than web scraping. Because of this, it may not be an ideal choice for every web scraping scenario, mainly due to its slower speed compared to other web scraping packages. Still, with a little background knowledge of HTML code, Selenium presents a good and precise option to scrape a variety of websites."
